# Meteor-HIPAA-Audit-Logger
Most of the HIPAA loggers use deprecated packages in tandem. This is a simple Audit Logger that stores activity into a database.

Credit goes to [Abigail Watson](https://github.com/awatson1978) for her [HIPAA Audit Logger](https://github.com/awatson1978/clinical-hipaa-audit-log). I took her router, simplified it and coded in coffeescript.
